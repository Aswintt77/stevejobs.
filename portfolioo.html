                <h3>Steven Paul Jobs &nbsp;&nbsp;(1955-2011)</h3>
                <p>Steve Jobs was a visionary entrepreneur and co-founder of Apple Inc., whose relentless pursuit of
                    innovation revolutionized the world of technology. Born on February 24, 1955, in San Francisco,
                    California, Jobs embarked on a lifelong journey that left an indelible mark on the tech industry and
                    beyond.

                    As a co-founder of Apple in 1976, Jobs introduced game-changing products, from the Macintosh
                    computer to the iPhone and iPad, setting new standards for design, functionality, and user
                    experience. His passion for simplicity and elegance redefined the way we interact with technology.

                    Despite facing setbacks, including a temporary departure from Apple, Jobs remained unwavering in his
                    commitment to pushing boundaries. His leadership led to Apple's resurgence and its status as one of
                    the world's most influential and valuable companies.

                    Jobs' impact extended far beyond the confines of corporate success. He inspired countless
                    individuals to dream big, take risks, and relentlessly pursue their goals. His memorable speeches
                    and quotes continue to motivate generations of entrepreneurs and innovators.

                    On October 5, 2011, Steve Jobs passed away, but his legacy lives on in the devices we use, the
                    companies we admire, and the ethos of thinking differently. He will forever be remembered as a
                    pioneer, a design luminary, and a true visionary."
